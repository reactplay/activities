A `reactplay` hustle

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies 
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
    **Note**: We do checkin yarn.lock file. So it's adviced to use `yarn` package manager. If you need to use any other package manager,remove `yarn.lock` file from local directory first. Also, do not check in any other lock file.
2. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project folder with the following content,

    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_BACKEND_URL=https://rgkjmwftqtbpayoyolwh.nhost.run
    NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN=rgkjmwftqtbpayoyolwh

    NEXT_PUBLIC_HACKATHON_ID=e606ae64-7c92-4344-94ad-4d0684458bcf
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HACKATHON_SUBMIT_STATUS_ID=ec1c0649-3b65-4809-92cf-9c4a6abdff1b
    ```
