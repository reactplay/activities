How about a platform that allows you to build a ReactJS application end-to-end, learn from the review comments, contribute to open source, showcase it to the world, and help build networking? #2PlaysAMonth aims precisely the same. Join the drive brought to you by ReactPlay and start building cool projects that we can't wait to see!",

We're looking forward to 4-5 days(based on how actively you respond to the comments) to complete the review process of a play. Try submitting your plays at least 7-10 days before the end date to avoid messy situations.
